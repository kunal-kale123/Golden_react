const handleSliderChange = (index, marks) => {
  if (index === 1) {
    const per = marks;
    console.log("Marks First row", per);

    // Create a new object with the key-value pair
    const newRating = { [index]: per };

    // Update the state with the new object
    setRating([newRating]);
  }
};

Explanation:-
See you cant use direct { index: per }.
In this code, the square brackets [index] around the index variable inside the object literal allow it to be used as a dynamic key. This way, the value of index will be used as the key in the resulting object.

For example, if index is 1 and per is 5, the resulting newRating object would be { 1: 5 }.
