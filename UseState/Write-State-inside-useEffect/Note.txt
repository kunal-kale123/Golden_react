const [time, setTime] = useState<number>(0);

// Calculate Total_time
let Total_time = 0;
courseContentData.forEach((data: any, idx: any) => {
  Total_time += data.time;
});

// Update the state with Total_time
useEffect(() => {
  setTime(Total_time);
}, []);

// Rest of your component code...

Note:- 

If you write setTime(Total_time) outside the useEffect hook, it will be executed every time the component re-renders. This can lead to an infinite loop because updating the state triggers a re-render, which then updates the state again, causing an endless cycle.

By placing setTime(Total_time) inside the useEffect hook, you ensure that it runs only once, during the component's initialization (when the empty dependency array [] is used). This way, the state update occurs after the component has rendered for the first time, avoiding any infinite loops.

Open kbhi bhi useState mt likho useEffect ke andr hi likho
