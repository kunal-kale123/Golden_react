1)Create Array
const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];

2)Access Array
const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
cars[0] = "Opel";

3)Converting an Array to a String

Arrays are Objects
Arrays are a special type of objects. The typeof operator in JavaScript returns "object" for arrays.

But, JavaScript arrays are best described as arrays.

Arrays use numbers to access its "elements". In this example, person[0] returns John:
Array:
const person = ["John", "Doe", 46];

Objects use names to access its "members". In this example, person.firstName returns John:
Object:
const person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:46};

Array Elements Can Be Objects
JavaScript variables can be objects. Arrays are special kinds of objects.

Because of this, you can have variables of different types in the same Array.

You can have objects in an Array. You can have functions in an Array. You can have arrays in an Array:

myArray[0] = Date.now;
myArray[1] = myFunction;
myArray[2] = myCars;

The Difference Between Arrays and Objects

In JavaScript, arrays use numbered indexes.  
In JavaScript, objects use named indexes.
