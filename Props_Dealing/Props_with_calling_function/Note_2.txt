-------------------------Pass A props with diffrent methods-------------------------
1)Passing Props as an Object:

The most common way is to pass props as an object, similar to what you're doing. For example:

javascript
Copy code
toolReportCol({
  prop1: value1,
  prop2: value2,
})
2)Passing Props as Individual Arguments:

You can pass each prop as a separate argument to the function or component:

javascript
Copy code
toolReportCol(prop1, prop2);
In this case, toolReportCol should expect these props as individual arguments.

3)Using Spread Operator:

If you have an object with props, you can use the spread operator to pass the props:

javascript
Copy code
const props = {
  prop1: value1,
  prop2: value2,
};

toolReportCol({ ...props });
This can be useful when you have a predefined set of props stored in an object.

4)Passing Props as an Array:

You can pass props as an array if the function or component expects them in that format:

javascript
Copy code
toolReportCol([prop1, prop2]);

  const { prop1, prop2 } = props;
}
