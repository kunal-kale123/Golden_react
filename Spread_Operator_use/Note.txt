const [formState, setFormState] = useState<FormState>({
    name: "",
    lname: "",
    email: "",
    password: "",
  });
-->formState is object
const handleChange = (event: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    const { name, value } = event.target;
    setFormState((prevState) => ({
      ...prevState,
      [name]: value,
    }));
  };

Note:- We are using here spread operator and changing values of object
