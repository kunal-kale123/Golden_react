Can I say this is blueprint and as per data new user will create

Yes, you can say that the User class or constructor function serves as a blueprint for creating new user objects. The code new User({ name, email, password: hashedPassword }) is using this blueprint to create a new user object with the specified data (i.e., name, email, and password: hashedPassword). This is a common pattern in object-oriented programming, where a class defines the structure and behavior of objects, and you use that class to create instances (objects) with specific data.
